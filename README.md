## CSE 310 : Final Project
#### Group # 43

#### Course project: Interest Groups 

Using the Internet domain sockets, implement a network application that supports interest-based discussion groups.
Your implementation consists of a client program and a server program. The client program allows an application user to login to the application, browse existing discussion groups, subscribe to those groups that are of interest, and read and write posts in a subscribed group. The server program allows a set of servers to maintain all the discussion groups, update the posts in each group, and interact with clients to support user activities.  You will design all communication protocols involved as well as other supporting elements such as how discussion groups and user posts are formatted, stored, and accessed and how user history is formatted and maintained.
You are to develop this project in groups of 3 students.
